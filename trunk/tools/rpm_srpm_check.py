# rpm-srpm-check.py
#     Takes a pile of RPMs and a pile of SRPMs and checks to
# ensure every RPM has a corresponding SRPM. Will report those
# RPMs lacking SRPMs and what SRPM it was expecting.
#     When optionally given a URI, will attempt to obtain the
# missing SRPMs from there.
#
# usage:
#    rpm-srpm-check.py <RPM-DIR> <SRPM-DIR>
