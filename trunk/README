At present, there is a very stupid installer.

Edit install.sh to suit your needs, and run it. Alternatively,
just copy the files by hand.

Note that if you store the lib files in a directory other than
/usr/lib/rpmstrap, you will either have to edit the rpmstrap
script itself to set the proper location, or set $RPMSTRAP_DIR
in your local environment to point to them.

If anyone wants to help out with the installer, please do so.
