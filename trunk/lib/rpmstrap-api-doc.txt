Can there be an API for a bash script? Why the heck not?

GLOBAL VARIABLES:
-----------------
The following are global variables available to the suite scripts.

DEBUG
JUST_PRINT_RPMS
DOWNLOAD_ONLY
ARCH
UNPACK_TARBALL
ADDITIONAL
LIST_SUITES
FIND_BEST_MIRROR        Boolean. If true, then the user has requested
                        finding the best mirror.
                        *Suite scripts should not modify this.*

BEST_MIRROR             In the event that we use one mirror, this
                        variable should house the best and/or default
                        one. Suite scripts MUST set this variable to
                        their desired default inside of
                        work_out_mirror() (either as default or as
                        the mirror determined by find_best_mirror().

LOCAL_SOURCE            Local repository of RPMs. This will be
                        used instead of downloading files.  Suite
                        scripts should not use this as this
                        location for RPMs. They should use
                        PKG_DIR instead.
                        *Suite scripts should not modify this.*

TMP_DIR                 Location of a temp directory for
                        downloading files. Suite scripts should
                        not use this as the location for RPMs.
                        They should use PKG_DIR instead.
                        *Suite scripts should not modify this.*

KEEP_TMP                Boolean for determining if the TMP_DIR
                        should be kept around after script is done.
                        Used with LOCAL_SOURCE as well as for
                        debugging purposes.
                        *Suite scripts should not modify this.*

PKG_DIR                 This will be the directory where the RPMs
                        will be stored locally. In the event that
                        we have LOCAL_SOURCE set, this will be
                        PKG_DIR, otherwise it will be TMP_DIR.
                        *Suite scripts should not modify this.*

MIRROR_LIST             Array of possible mirror choices. Suite
                        scripts can keep internal arrays for this,
                        but should populate this global one as well
                        in case the user requests TRY_MIRRORS.

TRY_MIRRORS             Boolean for determining if the app should
                        sequentially run down the mirror list.
