At present, there is a very stupid installer.

To install rpmstrap to the default locations, run the install script:
  $ ./install.sh
  
To purge or uninstall, run the script with the -p option:
  $ ./install.sh -p
  
The install script also has a very stupid help message if you run with -h:
  $ ./install.sh -h

You can specify different installation locations by exporting the following
variables before running the install script:
   $BINDIR
      This is where the binaries go. Defaults to /usr/bin
   $LIBDIR
      This is where the libraries go. Defaults to /usr/lib/rpmstrap
   $DOCDUR
      This is where the documentation goes. Defaults to /usr/share/doc

Note that if you store the lib files in a directory other than
/usr/lib/rpmstrap, you will either have to edit the rpmstrap
script itself to set the proper location, or set $RPMSTRAP_DIR
in your local environment to point to them.

If anyone wants to help out with the installer, please do so.
