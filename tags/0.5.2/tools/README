rpmstrap tools
--------------
Inside this directory you will find tools associated in some way with
rpmstrap.

* rpm_solver.py
   Basic Python script that can take a pool of RPMs and check for
   dependency closure. Additionally, if given a second pool containing
   all possible RPMs for a given distribution it will attempt to solve
   for dependency.
   
   If pool has dependency closure, rpm_solver.py will produce an
   installation order for the pool according to the RPM libraries.
   
   This installation order is then ready for use in an rpmstrap suite
   script.
   
* rpm_refiner.py
   Sometimes, RPM's libraries don't deal very well with circular
   dependencies (rather, they don't seem to expose those items
   necessary to deal with these circular dependencies to the API users).
   
   In these cases, rpm_solver.py will produce unusable installation
   orders.
   
   rpm_refiner.py takes a pool of RPMs which have dependency closure, and
   attempts to build chroots with them until it has worked out a usable
   installation order.
   
   If no order can be found, rpm_refiner.py will not work.

* rpm_get-arch.py
   Given a pool of RPMs for a given arch, this script will attempt
   to verify that you have (or can get) all RPMs for another arch.
   
   This script is useful if you have one arch all worked out (e.g.
   x86) but want to try to work out the rpmstrap script for
   another arch (e.g., ppc).
