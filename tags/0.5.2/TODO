* The x86_64 (and other archs) are buggy or not yet supported.
Right now, only i[3456]86 is. These archs should be added.

* Docs need to be better. There is very little explanation of
the necessary functions provided to suite scripts by rpmstrap.

* We need to decide how to handle RPM DB corruption. For example,
if I build a CentOS 4 chroot on my Debian box, I am doing so
with a radically different version of RPM than will be living
inside the CentOS 4 chroot. Sure you can rebuild it afterward
manually, but should the script handle this for you?

* Rename TMP_DIR to RPMSTRAP_TMP_DIR at some point to avoid
naming conflicts across other apps.
